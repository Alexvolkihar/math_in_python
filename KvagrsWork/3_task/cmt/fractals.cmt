At first this task seemed very hard, since recursion is still my weak site at programming, but after few tries I was able to achieve to draw each fractal. Next to the fractals you can see a gif animations, which gives a good insight, how the recursive process work in each fractal.

The tree-fractal become very easy to draw after saving the positions and directions in each nesting.

The koch-fractal is in fact drawn three times, each time from different position with different direction.

The sierpinski-fractal just draws a triangle for three different positions.

The last fractal is created with two turtles, although only one of them actually draws. The <i>drawing</i> turtle draws each pentagon, and the second turtle goes along the path of the polygon and saves six different coordinates - five for the <i>edge</i> polygons and on for the middle. Those coordinates then gives to the other turtle.
