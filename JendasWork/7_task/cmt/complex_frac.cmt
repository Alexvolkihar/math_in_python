I have implemented this program for Mandelbrot and Julia set even before the task was given and I saw no point
in spoiling it to actually see how much time Cython saves. 

At least I can provide difference between version, that uses mostly python data types to calculate 
Newtons fractal, and version purely written in Cython. Both programs were run on the same
machine a the task was to calculate 3000x2000 picture of Newtons fractal for the same area.

Cython with python data types: 79,23s

Pure Cython without any objective behavior: 5,34s

Conclusion: Pure Cython code was about 14.8 times faster than Cython code with mostly python
default data types. I expect pure Python to be measurably even slower.

Resulting Newtons fractal for function $z^3 - 1$

And now something from my own experiments:

$z^7 - 1$

&img="Newton_method2.png" alt="Newton_method2.png"

$z^7 + z^3 - 1$

$z^7 + 7z^4 - 13$

Then we have here the Mandelbrot set:

And finally Julia set:
