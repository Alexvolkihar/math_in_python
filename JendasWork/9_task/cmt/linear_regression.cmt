I implemented the linear regression using Mooreâ€“Penrose pseudo inverse matrix. It can be shown, 
it is equivalent to Least squares method, which is the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator(BLUE).

Formally written, we need to solve following equation $A\textbf{b} = \textbf{y}$, where b
represents vector of parameters of the line. Since rows are linearly independent, we can apply simple formula to calculate
the pseudo inverse: $A^{+} = (A^{*}A)^{-1}A^{*}$ and then 
we obtain the solution in form: $\textbf{b} = A^{+}\textbf{y}$

And now follows experiments with my own data. I generated normally distributed noise around line $-2x + 5$.

In accordance with the fact that, LS method is BLUE, I observed, that by adding more data, I will increase
the accuracy of my estimation.
