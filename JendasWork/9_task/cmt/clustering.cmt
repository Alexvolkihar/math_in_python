First plot shows data clustering for 'cluster_data.txt' file:

Then I implemented cluster generator. Stars represent original cluster centroids, hexagons approximated centroids.

7 clusters, low noise variance:

7 clusters, high noise variance:

&img="clustering_sigma100.png" alt="clustering_sigma100.png"

7 clusters, random noise variance for each cluster:

&img="clustering_sigma50random.png" alt="clustering_sigma50random.png"

It can be seen that for low noise variance are results quite accurate and the process took only few rounds
to converge. On the other hand, cluster crossfading caused the process to perform significantly more iterations 
(about twice more) and approximation quality is quite poor.
